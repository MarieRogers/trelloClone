This project includes many necessary components. I also went beyond the requirements listed below to add extra functionality in customization and card contents.

### Work with lists
Create lists with a name, edit that name, or remove the entire list
Change the order in which the lists are displayed (using basic input techniques like buttons or text fields, etc.)
Collapse or expand lists

### Work with cards
Create cards with a name, edit that name, or remove cards
Add cards to a list or move cards to another list (using basic input techniques like buttons or text fields, etc.)
Show status data about the card such as when it was created or how close it is to being completed

### Work with users (primarily for information purposes, not for authentication because any user can make any kind of change to the project)
Create users with a name, email, and image (no password)
"Sign in" by entering name or email (if there is a match the user is allowed in)
Change user's name, email, or image

### Customize a project
Choose a background color or image
Choose categories for cards and colors for those categories
Filter visible cards by category or date created

### Click on card to see expanded view of it that contains
Name
Description (which could include HTML tags)
Deadline
Image attachments
Todo list that represents smaller tasks associated with this card

I used a variety of resouces. I took some CSS code for the modals from the Vue documentation online. I heavily edited and changed everything that I directly took in order to make it fit my specific project. I also referenced Stack Overflow, but did not directly copy code from there.
